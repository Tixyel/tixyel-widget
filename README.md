# An Extension Made by Me, for Me

## What Does It Do?

Simply put, it creates and assists in my custom widget development for stream elements.

## What It Can Do:

- Create template folders
- Create a closed folder
- Create a .zip file for the widget.io

This extension will not be updated frequently, only when I deem it necessary.
